            "highly probable that in this great class organs which once served\n",
            "for respiration have been actually converted into organs for flight.\n",
            "  In considering transitions of organs, it is so important to bear\n",
            "in mind the probability of conversion from one function to another,\n",
            "that I will give another instance. Pedunculated cirripedes have two\n",
            "minute folds of skin, called by me the ovigerous frena, which serve,\n",
            "through the means of a sticky secretion, to retain the eggs until they\n",
            "are hatched within the sack. These cirripedes have no branchiae, the\n",
            "whole surface of the body and of the sack, together with the small\n",
            "frena, serving for respiration. The Balanidae or sessile cirripedes,\n",
            "on the other hand, have no ovigerous frena, the eggs lying loose at\n",
            "the bottom of the sack, within the well-enclosed shell; but they have,\n",
            "in the same relative position with the frena, large, much-folded\n",
            "membranes, which freely communicate with the circulatory lacunae of\n",
            "the sack and body, and which have been considered by all naturalists\n",
            "to act as branchiae. Now I think no one will dispute that the\n",
            "ovigerous frena in the one family are strictly homologous with the\n",
            "branchiae of the other family; indeed, they graduate into each\n",
            "other. Therefore it need not be doubted that the two little folds of\n",

            "very slightly aided in the act of respiration, have been gradually\n",

            "are admirably adapted by their flattened and asymmetrical structure\n",
            "for their habits of life, is manifest from several species, such as\n",
            "soles, flounders, &c., being extremely common. The chief advantages\n",
            "thus gained seem to be protection from their enemies, and facility for\n",

            "owing to the excessive depth of their bodies, the small size of\n",
            "their lateral fins, and to their being destitute of a swimbladder.\n",
            "Hence soon growing tired, they fall to the bottom on one side.\n",

            "Pleuronectidae, on the other hand, the older they grow the more\n",
            "habitually they rest on one side, owing to the increasing flatness\n",
            "of their bodies, and a permanent effect is thus produced on the form\n",
            "of the head, and on the position of the eyes. Judging from analogy,\n",
            "the tendency to distortion would no doubt be increased through the\n",
            "principle of inheritance. Schiodte believes, in opposition to some\n",
            "other naturalists, that the Pleuronectidae are not quite symmetrical\n",
            "even in the embryo; and if this be so, we could understand how it is\n",
            "that certain species, whilst young, habitually fall over and rest on\n",

            "of defence. Mr. Agassiz, to whose great kindness I am indebted for\n",
            "much information on the subject, informs me that there are other\n",
            "star-fishes, in which one of the three arms of the forceps is\n",
            "reduced to a support for the other two; and again, other genera in\n",

            "described by M. Perrier as bearing two kinds of pedicellariae, one\n",
            "resembling those of Echinus, and the other those of Spatangus; and\n",
            "such cases are always interesting as affording the means of apparently\n",

            "Muller, that both in star-fishes and sea-urchins the pedicellariae\n",
            "must undoubtedly be looked at as modified spines. This may be inferred\n",
            "from their manner of development in the individual, as well as from\n",
            "a long and perfect series of gradations in different species and\n",
            "genera, from simple granules to ordinary spines, to perfect tridactyle\n",
            "pedicellariae. The gradations extend even to the manner in which\n",
            "ordinary spines and pedicellariae with their supporting calcareous\n",
            "rods are articulated to the shell. In certain genera of star-fishes,\n",
            "\"the very combinations needed to show that the pedicellariae are\n",
            "only modified branching spines\" may be found. Thus we have fixed\n",
            "spines, with three equidistant, serrated, moveable branches,\n",
            "articulated to near their bases; and higher up, on the same spine,\n",
            "three other moveable branches. Now when the latter arise from the\n",
            "summit of a spine they form in fact a rude tridactyle pedicellaria,\n",
            "and such may be seen on the same spine together with the three lower\n",
            "branches. In this case the identity in nature between the arms of\n",
            "the pedicellariae and the moveable branches of a spine, is\n",
            "unmistakable. It is generally admitted that the ordinary spines\n",
            "serve as a protection; and if so, there can be no reason to doubt that\n",
            "those furnished with serrated and moveable branches likewise serve for\n",
            "the same purpose; and they would thus serve still more effectively\n",
            "as soon as by meeting together they acted as a prehensile or\n",
            "snapping apparatus. Thus every gradation, from an ordinary fixed spine\n",
            "to a fixed pedicellaria, would be of service.\n",
            "  In certain genera of star-fishes these organs, instead of being\n",
            "fixed or borne on an immoveable support, are placed on the summit of a\n",

            "is concerned, I can see no similarity between tridactyle pedicellariae\n",
            "and avicularia. The latter resemble somewhat more closely the chelae\n",

            "while to show that with the former a long series of serviceable\n",
            "gradations still exists. In the first and simplest stage, the terminal\n",
            "segment of a limb shuts down either on the square summit of the\n",
            "broad penultimate segment, or against one whole side; and is thus\n",
            "enabled to catch hold of an object; but the limb still serves as an\n",
            "organ of locomotion. We next find one corner of the broad\n",
            "penultimate segment slightly prominent, sometimes furnished with\n",
            "irregular teeth; and against these the terminal segment shuts down. By\n",

            "Hence we can understand how it is that these organs graduate in some\n",

            "much produced and is so like a bristle, that the presence of the upper\n",
            "or fixed beak alone serves to determine even its avicularian nature.\n",
            "The vibracula may have been directly developed from the lips of the\n",
            "cells, without having passed through the avicularian stage; but it\n",
            "seems more probable that they have passed through this stage, as\n",

            "  In the vegetable kingdom Mr. Mivart only alludes to two cases,\n",
            "namely the structure of the flowers of orchids, and the movements of\n",
            "climbing plants. With respect to the former, he says, \"The explanation\n",
            "of their origin is deemed thoroughly unsatisfactory- utterly\n",
            "insufficient to explain the incipient, infinitesimal beginnings of\n",
            "structures which are of utility only when they are considerably\n",
            "developed.\" As I have fully treated this subject in another work, I\n",
            "will here give only a few details on one alone of the most striking\n",
            "peculiarities of the flowers of orchids, namely their pollinia. A\n",
            "pollinium when highly developed consists of a mass of pollen-grains,\n",
            "affixed to an elastic footstalk or caudicle, and this to a little mass\n",
            "of extremely viscid matter. The pollinia are by this means transported\n",
            "by insects from one flower to the stigma of another. In some orchids\n",
            "there is no caudicle to the pollen-masses, and the grains are merely\n",
            "tied together by fine threads; but as these are not confined to\n",
            "orchids, they need not here be considered; yet I may mention that at\n",
            "the base of the orchidaceous series, in Cypripedium, we can see how\n",
            "the threads were probably first developed. In other orchids the\n",
            "threads cohere at one end of the pollen-masses; and this forms the\n",
            "first or nascent trace of a caudicle. That this is the origin of the\n",
            "caudicle, even when of considerable length and highly developed, we\n",
            "have good evidence in the aborted pollen-grains which can sometimes be\n",
            "detected embedded within the central and solid parts.\n",
            "  With respect to the second chief peculiarity, namely the little mass\n",
            "of viscid matter attached to the end of the caudicle, a long series of\n",
            "gradations can be specified, each of plain service to the plant. In\n",
            "most flowers belonging to other orders the stigma secretes a little\n",
            "viscid matter. Now in certain orchids similar viscid matter is\n",
            "secreted, but in much larger quantities by one alone of the three\n",
            "stigmas; and this stigma, perhaps in consequence of the copious\n",
            "secretion, is rendered sterile. When an insect visits a flower of this\n",
            "kind, it rubs off some of the viscid matter and thus at the same\n",
            "time drags away some of the pollen-grains. From this simple condition,\n",
            "which differs but little from that of a multitude of common flowers,\n",
            "there are endless gradations,- to species in which the pollen-mass\n",
            "terminates in a very short, free caudicle,- to others in which the\n",
            "caudicle becomes firmly attached to the viscid matter, with the\n",
            "sterile stigma itself much modified. In this latter case we have a\n",
            "pollinium in its most highly developed and perfect condition. He who\n",
            "will carefully examine the flowers of orchids for himself will not\n",
            "deny the existence of the above series of gradations- from a mass of\n",
            "pollen-grains merely tied together by threads, with the stigma\n",
            "differing but little from that of an ordinary flower, to a highly\n",

            "in a high degree to the species. For instance, it is clearly a great\n",
            "advantage to a twining plant to become a leaf-climber; and it is\n",
            "probable that every twiner which possessed leaves with long\n",

            "sensitiveness to a touch.\n",
            "  As twining is the simplest means of ascending a support, and forms\n",
            "the basis of our series, it may naturally be asked how did plants\n",
            "acquire this power in an incipient degree, afterwards to be improved\n",
            "and increased through natural selection. The power of twining depends,\n",
            "firstly, on the stems whilst young being extremely flexible (but\n",
            "this is a character common to many plants which are not climbers);\n",
            "and, secondly, on their continually bending to all points of the\n",
            "compass, one after the other in succession, in the same order. By this\n",
            "movement the stems are inclined to all sides, and are made to move\n",
            "round and round. As soon as the lower part of a stem strikes against\n",
            "any object and is stopped, the upper part still goes on bending and\n",
            "revolving, and thus necessarily twines round and up the support. The\n",
            "revolving movement ceases after the early growth of each shoot. As\n",
            "in many widely separated families of plants, single species and single\n",
            "genera possess the power of revolving, and have thus become twiners,\n",
            "they must have independently acquired it, and cannot have inherited it\n",
            "from a common progenitor. Hence I was led to predict that some\n",
            "slight tendency to a movement of this kind would be found to be far\n",
            "from uncommon with plants which did not climb; and that this had\n",
            "afforded the basis for natural selection to work on and improve.\n",
            "When I made this prediction, I knew of only one imperfect case,\n",
            "namely, of the young flower-peduncles of a Maurandia which revolved\n",
            "slightly and irregularly, like the stems of twining plants, but\n",
            "without making any use of this habit. Soon afterwards Fritz Muller\n",
            "discovered that the young stems of an Alisima and of a Linum,-\n",
            "plants which do not climb and are widely separated in the natural\n",

            "has reason to suspect that this occurs with some other plants. These\n",
            "slight movements appear to be of no service to the plants in question;\n",
            "anyhow, they are not of the least use in the way of climbing, which is\n",
            "the point that concerns us. Nevertheless we can see that if the\n",
            "stems of these plants had been flexible, and if under the conditions\n",
            "to which they are exposed it had profited them to ascend to a\n",

            "case: I observed that the young flower-peduncles of the above\n",

            "when they were gently and repeatedly touched, or when the plant was\n",
            "shaken. I repeated these observations on some other species of\n",
            "Oxalis with the same result; in some of them the movement was\n",

            "  IN THE sixth chapter I enumerated the chief objections which might\n",
            "be justly urged against the views maintained in this volume. Most of\n",
            "them have now been discussed. One, namely the distinctness of specific\n",
            "forms, and their not being blended together by innumerable\n",
            "transitional links, is a very obvious difficulty. I assigned reasons\n",

            "circumstances apparently most favourable for their presence, namely,\n",
            "on an extensive and continuous area with graduated physical\n",

            "intermediate varieties, from existing in lesser numbers than the forms\n",
            "which they connect, will generally be beaten out and exterminated\n",
            "during the course of further modification and improvement. The main\n",
            "cause, however, of innumerable intermediate links not now occurring\n",
            "everywhere throughout nature, depends on the very process of natural\n",
            "selection, through which new varieties continually take the places\n",
            "of and supplant their parent-forms. But just in proportion as this\n",

            "imperfection of the geological record.\n",
            "  In the first place, it should always be borne in mind what sort of\n",

            "the explanation is obvious on the principle of descent with\n",

            "conversely it will be with the northern hemisphere, whilst the\n",

            "  In the regular course of events the southern hemisphere would in\n",

            "would invade the equatorial lowlands. The northern forms which had\n",
            "before been left on the mountains would now descend and mingle with\n",
            "the southern forms. These latter, when the warmth returned, would\n",
            "return to their former homes, leaving some few species on the\n",

            "more identical or slightly modified species have migrated from the\n",

            "dogs and their six-days-old puppies, I found that the puppies had\n",
            "not acquired nearly their full amount of proportional difference.\n",
            "So, again, I was told that the foals of cart- and race-horses-\n",
            "breeds which have been almost wholly formed by selection under\n",
            "domestication- differed as much as the full-grown animals; but\n",
            "having had careful measurements made of the dams and of three-days-old\n",
            "colts of race and heavy cart-horses, I find that this is by no means\n",
            "the case.\n",
            "  As we have conclusive evidence that the breeds of the pigeon are\n",
            "descended from a single wild species, I compared the young within\n",
            "twelve hours after being hatched; I carefully measured the proportions\n",
            "(but will not here give the details) of the beak, width of mouth,\n",

            "the wild parent-species, in pouters, fantails, runts, barbs,\n",
            "dragons, carriers, and tumblers. Now some of these birds, when mature,\n",
            "differ in so extraordinary a manner in the length and form of beak,\n",
            "and in other characters, that they would certainly have been ranked as\n",

            "them could just be distinguished, the proportional differences in\n",
            "the above specified points were incomparably less than in the\n",
            "full-grown birds. Some characteristic points of difference- for\n",
            "instance, that of the width of mouth- could hardly be detected in\n",
            "the young. But there was one remarkable exception to this rule, for\n",
            "the young of the short-faced tumbler differed from the young of the\n",
            "wild rock-pigeon and of the other breeds, in almost exactly the same\n",
            "proportions as in the adult state.\n",
            "  These facts are explained by the above two principles. Fanciers\n",
            "select their dogs, horses, pigeons, &c., for breeding, when nearly\n",
            "grown up: they are indifferent whether the desired qualities are\n",
            "acquired earlier or later in life, if the full-grown animal\n",
            "possesses them. And the cases just given, more especially that of\n",
            "the pigeons, show that the characteristic differences which have\n",
            "been accumulated by man's selection, and which give value to his\n",
            "breeds, do not generally appear at a very early period of life, and\n",
            "are inherited at a corresponding not early period. But the case of the\n",
            "shortfaced tumbler, which when twelve hours old possessed its proper\n",
            "characters, proves that this is not the universal rule; for here the\n",
            "characteristic differences must either have appeared at an earlier\n",
            "period than usual, or, if not so, the differences must have been\n",
            "inherited, not at a corresponding, but at an earlier age.\n",
            "  Now let us apply these two principles to species in a state of\n",
            "nature. Let us take a group of birds, descended from some ancient\n",
            "form and modified through natural selection for different habits.\n",
            "Then, from the many slight successive variations having supervened\n",
            "in the several species at a not early age, and having been inherited\n",
            "at a corresponding age, the young will have been but little\n",
            "modified, and they will still resemble each other much more closely\n",
            "than do the adults,- just as we have seen with the breeds of the\n",
            "pigeon. We may extend this view to widely distinct structures and to\n",
            "whole classes. The fore-limbs, for instance, which once served as legs\n",
            "to a remote progenitor, may have become, through a long course of\n",
            "modification, adapted in one descendant to act as hands, in another as\n",
            "paddles, in another as wings; but on the above two principles the\n",
            "fore-limbs will not have been much modified in the embryos of these\n",
            "several forms; although in each form the fore-limb will differ greatly\n",
            "in the adult state. Whatever influence long-continued use or disuse\n",
            "may have had in modifying the limbs or other parts of any species,\n",
            "this will chiefly or solely have affected it when nearly mature,\n",
            "when it was compelled to use its full powers to gain its own living;\n",
            "and the effects thus produced will have been transmitted to the\n",
            "offspring at a corresponding nearly mature age. Thus the young will\n",
            "not be modified, or will be modified only in a slight degree,\n",
            "through the effects of the increased use or disuse of parts.\n",
            "  With some animals the successive variations may have supervened at a\n",
            "very early period of life, or the steps may have been inherited at\n",
            "an earlier age than that at which they first occurred. In either of\n",
            "these cases, the young or embryo will closely resemble the mature\n",
            "parent-form, as we have seen with the short-faced tumbler. And this is\n",
            "the rule of development in certain whole groups, or in certain\n",
            "sub-groups alone, as with cuttle-fish, land-shells, fresh-water\n",
            "crustaceans, spiders, and some members of the great class of\n",
            "insects. With respect to the final cause of the young in such groups\n",
            "not passing through any metamorphosis, we can see that this would\n",
            "follow from the following contingencies; namely, from the young having\n",

            "case, it would be indispensable for their existence that they should\n",
            "be modified in the same manner as their parents. Again, with respect\n",
            "to the singular fact that many terrestrial and fresh-water animals\n",
            "do not undergo any metamorphosis, whilst marine members of the same\n",
            "groups pass through various transformations, Fritz Muller has\n",
            "suggested that the process of slowly modifying and adapting an\n",
            "animal to live on the land or in fresh water, instead of in the sea,\n",
            "would be greatly simplified by its not passing through any larval\n",
            "stage; for it is not probable that places well adapted for both the\n",
            "larval and mature stages, under such new and greatly changed habits of\n",
            "life, would commonly be found unoccupied or ill-occupied by other\n",
            "organisms. In this case the gradual acquirement at an earlier and\n",
            "earlier age of the adult structure would be favoured by natural\n",
            "selection; and all traces of former metamorphoses would finally be\n",
            "lost.\n",
            "  If, on the other hand, it profited the young of an animal to\n",
            "follow habits of life slightly different from those of the\n",
            "parent-form, and consequently to be constructed on a slightly\n",
            "different plan, or if it profited a larva already different from its\n",
            "parent to change still further, then, on the principle of\n",
            "inheritance at corresponding ages, the young or the larvae might be\n",
            "rendered by natural selection more and more different from their\n",
            "parents to any conceivable extent. Differences in the larva might,\n",
            "also, become correlated with successive stages of its development;\n",
            "so that the larva, in the first stage might come to differ greatly\n",
            "from the larva in the second stage, as is the case with many\n",
            "animals. The adult might also become fitted for sites or habits, in\n",
            "which organs of locomotion or of the senses, &c., would be useless;\n",
            "and in this case the metamorphosis would be retrograde.\n",
            "  From the remarks just made we can see how by changes of structure in\n",
            "the young, in conformity with changed habits of life, together with\n",
            "inheritance at corresponding ages, animals might come to pass\n",
            "through stages of development, perfectly distinct from the\n",
            "primordial condition of their adult progenitors. Most of our best\n",
            "authorities are now convinced that the various larval and pupal stages\n",
            "of insects have thus been acquired through adaptation, and not\n",
            "through inheritance from some ancient form. The curious case of\n",
            "Sitaris- a beetle which passes through certain unusual stages of\n",
            "development- will illustrate how this might occur. The first larval\n",
            "form is described by M. Fabre, as an active, minute insect,\n",
            "furnished with six legs, two long antennae, and four eyes. These\n",
            "larvae are hatched in the nests of bees; and when the male-bees emerge\n",
            "from their burrows, in the spring, which they do before the females,\n",
            "the larvae spring on them, and afterwards crawl on to the females\n",
            "whilst paired with the males. As soon as the female bee deposits her\n",
            "eggs on the surface of the honey stored in the cells, the larvas of\n",
            "the Sitaris leap on the eggs and devour them. Afterwards they\n",
            "undergo a complete change; their eyes disappear; their legs and\n",
            "antennae become rudimentary, and they feed on honey; so that they\n",
            "now more closely resemble the ordinary larvae of insects; ultimately\n",
            "they undergo a further transformation, and finally emerge as the\n",
            "perfect beetle. Now, if an insect, undergoing transformations like\n",
            "those of the Sitaris, were to become the progenitor of a whole new\n",
            "class of insects, the course of development of the new class would\n",
            "be widely different from that of our existing insects; and the first\n",
            "larval stage certainly would not represent the former condition of\n",
            "any adult and ancient form.\n",
            "  On the other hand it is highly probable that with many animals the\n",
            "embryonic or larval stages show us, more or less completely, the\n",
            "condition of the progenitor of the whole group in its adult state.\n",
            "In the great class of the Crustacea, forms wonderfully distinct from\n",
            "each other, namely, suctorial parasites, cirripedes, entomostraca, and\n",
            "even the malacostraca, appear at first as larvae under the\n",
            "nauplius-form; and as these larvae live and feed in the open sea,\n",
            "and are not adapted for any peculiar habits of life, and from other\n",
            "reasons assigned by Fritz Muller it is probable that at some very\n",
            "remote period an independent adult animal, resembling the nauplius,\n",
            "existed, and subsequently produced, along several divergent lines of\n",
            "descent, the above-named great crustacean groups. So again it is\n",
            "probable, from what we know of the embryos of mammals, birds,\n",
            "fishes, and reptiles, that these animals are the modified\n",
            "descendants of some ancient progenitor, which was furnished in its\n",
